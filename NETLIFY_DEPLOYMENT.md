## 🔧 **If You Still Want Leap Cell:**

The issue is that Leap Cell expects a persistent server, not pure serverless. You'd need to:
1. Choose "Persistent Server" (costs money)
2. Use the Express server configuration
3. Pay for 24/7 server hosting

## 💡 **Recommendation:**

**Use Netlify!** It's specifically designed for this type of deployment and will work flawlessly with your setup.
